## MyCv
-Problem Statement
-  Millions struggle to build impactful resumes. Traditional formats are time-consuming, inaccessible, and don't tailor to specific jobs. This hinders interview chances.
  -Solution
        MyCV simplifies resume creation with AI. It analyzes your skills (from uploads like LinkedIn profiles) and highlights what matters in job descriptions, making resumes impactful and accessible (screen readers, fonts) for all.
   While MyCV focuses on empowering job seekers, there's potential for an  "Organizations" feature with limitations:

Challenge Faced By Organiztions :  Analyzing resumes for skills and experience without opening them requires advanced NLP capabilities that might not be fully available yet.
    Organizations can offer MyCV as a tool for applicants during the application process.
    Applicants upload resumes to MyCV, which then analyzes them and generates a standardized skills summary for employers.
    This reduces manual resume screening time while still providing valuable insights.
